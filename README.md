This project is just a way for me and my friends to practice our web development skills.
right now we are in stage one, where we created a dictionary of random questions and corresponding answers. 
the user is asked to ask a question and the corresponding answer will be logged on the screen.
Anyone who wants to improve the code or present a new idea is highly welcome to do so.
i want to give a shoutout to my niggers in ##-_CODING CAMP_- and -_ASSUTECH GEN2.0_-
